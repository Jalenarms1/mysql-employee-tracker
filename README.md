# mysql-employee-tracker

## Description

The user, when running the application, will be required to choose an action they would like to take on their database. Base on that option they will either be shown the information requested, or they will be prompted to answer a set of questions if they want to add, update or delete an item. Once entering the neccessary information, their new item will be inserted into the corresponding database.

## Developer notes

This application was very useful in getting acquainted with MySQL and using queries to store, view and change inforamation from a database. This has seemed like the best way to store and retrieve data thus far and I'm looking forward to utilizing this more in my projects and assignments.
